Informal To-Do List

Priorities
1. HMACs
2. Break fragmentor and reassembler into sub-modules (and pass all necessary state via agents)
2. Address partition-level parallelism
3. Address slow dummy creation speed (read from /urandom in a chunk instead of generating 0s?)
4. Build a CLI (important!!!)
5. Make project "production ready" 
    - Take out hard coded paths
    - Refactor where necessary
    - Comment where necessary
    - Add ModuleDocs
    - Testing
    - CLI (!!!)

Reach Goals
1. Figure out formula to determine optimal partition size based on RAM and cores
2. Figure out formula to determine optimal thread pool size based on machine
3. Write make file to install program in usr/bash to allow for simple Unix shortcut to use utility
4. Add CLI flags/options to pick and choose security vs speed optimizations (+ others)
5. Succesfully fragment a 1TB file in < 15 minutes
6. Succesfully reassemble a 1TB file in < 20 minutes
