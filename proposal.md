## Proposed Project

I plan to implement the 2048 game using elixir. Currently, in my mind,
it will be a console program, since I may not have enough time to make
a cool web interface for it. After that, if I have enough time, I will
try to create a web interface.

## Outline Structure

The project will have four modules: game, input, move, board.
The application will supervise the game.
