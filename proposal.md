## Proposed Project

For this assignment, I will build a communication application for a modern framework of digital communication. The app will include 4 components, with individual features as part of each one:
1. User profile and addressing specification (similar to Bitcoin)
2. Message templating and tagging
3. Notification prioritization selection option
4. Relationship logging and profiling

It will be hosted as a webapp and function much—as far as user interfaces go—like Slack. This ironically pairs much of the basic human interaction of how we communicate with the paradigm of how protocols are communicated across BEAM nodes.

## Outline Structure

It will be built on the Phoenix Framework, with builtin OTP processes and servers for each user and each addressing specification with address filtering.
State transfer will take place in the message templating schema for users to request and respond to messages based on user provided templates.
