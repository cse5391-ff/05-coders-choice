## Proposed Project

I will create a web application that will take in someone's birthday
and it will send them reminders on their mathematical birthday. Some of
these birthdays will be celebrating things like:
<br>
- Prime birthdays: a prime number of days since your birthday
- 250 months, 500 months, 750 months since your birthday
- 1,000 weeks, 2,000 weeks ...
- 10,000 days, 20,000 days ...
- 10,000 hours, 20,000 hours ...
- 10,000,000 minutes, 20,000,000 minutes ...
- 0.5 billion seconds, 1 billion seconds ...
- Pi ^ Pi birthday: 36 years and 169 days


## Outline Structure

I will split the code in multiple modules: a module to handle the user
process, a module to send the notifications, modules to handle the user
interface, module to supervise the user processes. I am planning to use the 
phoenix framework. There will be a process for every user in the system.
There will also be a supervisor over all the user processes.
